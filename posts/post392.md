Ok so a scratch named [](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheComputorBoss9776) is being hurt in irl by bad parents... She has insomia, and some metal illness and her parents don't care... They only care about her grades...

**How to prevent and solve this**:

Go to a counsolor or any close family members or staff of a school to talk about it... They will try to solve this problems or have a person aressted... Pls aid he/her as she need metal help... I had a small chat with her and it helped lighten the mood... Just pls help her and scratch on!
