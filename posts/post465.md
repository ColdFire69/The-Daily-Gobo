#New game? Real???
I'm currently working on making a new game called ksps, kerbal space program scratch edition. I got inspired by the new feature video for ksp2 to make a game that (*will*) have some of the beloved features of ksp such as atmospheric heating (RIP jeb) and huge boosters that barley fit on the screen! The game will hopefully come out sometime next year. Stay tuned for updates
