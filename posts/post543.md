# SCP 3008 Game Is Available 
I Made a really cool SCP game  for celebrating 800 followersðŸŽ‰ , Im Soon going to add a Daily Gobo secret Or maybe Just  something on a shelf... But it's well made and has a lott of good details and There is a 2nd map that I like to change every now and then. Its a really big game and It really gives the player the feeling of "Excitement" when you finally escape
this game was beta tested and Is now fully released. I have gotten a lot of ideas from people when making it. Here is a link to the game feel free to check it out  [SCP 3008 *Fazbear Halls*  (4X Series )](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/689687413).
  Have a great day ðŸ˜„
