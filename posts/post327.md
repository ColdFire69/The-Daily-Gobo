# Announcement 
### Introduction
Hello fellow scratchers! (Yes griffpatch line) I’m [OrangeAwesome](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OrangeAwesome/) and I’m back with another post. Hope your day/night is going well, and hope it keeps going well. :D
### The Studio
- I am posting this announcement because I am starting my own kind of ‘Propose Projects to be Featured’ studio.
- Every week, I will be choosing 3 different projects that I like from [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32230271/curators) studio and making a post here on the daily gobo, as well as putting the project links on my profile.
- Ask on my [profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OrangeAwesome/) if you would like to be a curator and add projects that you like and would like to be featured!
## Rules
1. No adding projects that are your own
1. Only add projects that follow the scratch community [guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines), if they don’t, report them instead
1. If you want to add your own projects, run it by another curator to be added
1. Do not feature projects asked by a new scratcher, and check that the project is not too famous, we want good projects, that need to be noticed
1. Add a whole bunch of different categories of projects, like art, animations, games, simulations, and more

### Ending 
Hope you ask to join the studio, and hope you have a good day/night! :D
