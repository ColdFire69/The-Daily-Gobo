BeepyPie's Guide to the Scratch Editor Part 1: The Basics


























Sooo, are you new to Scratch? In one of my previous posts, I suggested making your own art. However, what if you don't know HOW? 



First, open a new project. Then, delete the sprite titled 'sprite1.' After that, hover over the 'Choose a Sprite' button (it looks like a cat) and select the paintbrush. You should now see an area with a a grid background and a bunch of tools on the side. This is the editor. Now, make sure the blue rectangle at the bottom says 'Convert to BITMAP.' 

You see that? Great. Now, let me introduce the tools. The first icon is a mouse pointer. This is a select tool, which is pretty straightforward. The next icon is the point editor. It looks like a mouse selecting a dot. To use this tool, create a circle by selecting the circle-shaped tool. Drag your mouse across the screen to create a circle. Now, select any part of the outline of the circle and  a blue dot should appear! You can drag this around to make different shapes, and you can make more points to make it more detailed!

Bye for now! More coming soon!
