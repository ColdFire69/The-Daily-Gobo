Hey guys! I'm back again with some new Scratch stuff! Let's dive in!!! 

First up today is [Fill The Gap Platformer](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/670212530/) by [PLAYtntGAMER](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PLAYtntGAMER)!

I've never seen this type of game where you literally have to blend into the background and fit into missing pieces as a platformer style before! Very creative I will say! Definitely would come back to in the future!

Second game of today is [Blocktopus](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/684062561/) by [panther_](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/panther__)!

I really like the gameplay! It's a nice octopus game! The music gives me Portal vibes mainly as it sounds a lot like something that could be in the Portal soundtrack. Very cool level design too!

Our final game today is [Landmarks/Sights 2.5D v1.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/728039377/) by [epic fire ghost](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/epic_fire_ghost)!

A very informational project about the landmarks! I love how it's like kind of 3D! I wish there was more landmarks though than just 4 but there probably will be more. A cool project nonetheless though!

I hope you enjoyed my blog post today! Comment on one my projects if you enjoyed today's post! (if I forget to post sometimes it usually means I'm a little busy or I just can't do it so don't worry!)

I'll see you soon!
