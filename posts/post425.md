Ok, that was just the starting of my blog since I was told not to just write a few sentences!
Anyway, recently I have been going into my slime rancher and Ooblets phase those games are just so cutee! 
I am currently obsessed with them, if anyone likes them too pleasee come to my profile and geek with me hh ^^

I am also in the mood for coding but can't think of a concept :(
After my game "Cat & Toast" got so popular, I think I know a bit of what people like in a game! 
Tips: Cute/cool graphics, Original game idea, Kinda themed colours... Basically, just put your effort in the game and people would sure to appreciate it!

That's all for my blog post, hope you all had fun reading this! (I didn't expect it to be so long ;-;)
