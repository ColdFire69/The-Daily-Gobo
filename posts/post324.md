Hello Scratch community! I am @Imthebestcreator234 on scratch! I am here today to tell you all about the danger of scratch studio wars.

First, let me try you why they are bad. They get people blocked, mass reported, banned, people become mean, disrespectful and people forget that they are doing this to a real person. I think scratch studios that are empires can stay but, people need to stop with the wars.

Second, long time friend can get stuck on one side then never become friends again. It is sad. Would you want that to happen to you? No, that is why I want studio wars to end for good.

My Finale thoughts? Well. They aren't all that bad. But they are bad enough to get people banned for life. Please do not let there be any more scratch wars!
