# *The Ascension(A history by Me)English version*
Hello again my friends ! But today I am going to ask you something, you have already play a game, watch an animation, be rickrolled, and more all in scratch but have you even see a Story before? 

Even if they exist in scratch they aren't very famous or normal to find, But I Am Going go tell you about a **boy**, a **normal boy in 1170**, in a **fantasy world**, that will **become** a **soldadier**, his kingdmom saver and hereo, a **general**, and a **King** His name is Venrihon I and he will be rembered by all the Atesses population...

This Story isn't complete, but I have ⅕ of the first chapter ready, and I will only publish the first chapter because :

1. I don't want to someone copy my story ;
2. I don't have very time do make it ;
3. And because this will be a colection.

I hope you **don't** get **mad** on me because of that. Anyway Iam planing to do more ⅕ briefly and that will make ⅖ of the first chapter ready, anyway here is the link :

**Enjoy the rest of your day** , ***WhatijStudios***
