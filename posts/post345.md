## Featured Projects 

### Project Number 1:
\> [Intro for -savior- || Entry](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/671388913) <

I liked this project because it is a very well made intro, and very smooth too. 
I feel like this project should have a lot more people seeing it, because this seems like something the creator put a lot of time into this project, and I don’t want that time to not be acknowledged.

### Project Number 2:

\> [Raking Simulator v1.1](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/707592470) <

I love how fun this game is to play. It is kind of slow at the start, but after a while it really starts going!
It has a background story on the description, and has a lot of blocks and time going into it. 
I like how this game has many elements to it, like different rakes, going into leaf blowers, and even better leaf spawning and more area to spawn leaves.

### Featured Project 3:

\> [Gravity Switch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/741867879) <

I like this project because it is a really big time killer, it doesn’t have many views, but it has effort put into it, so I hope this gets some views.
This project has a good score system, and it has a little bit of a challenge, but not too much. 

## Ending

Hope you all have a good rest of your day/night! :D
