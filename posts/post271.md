# We Have an Update to Our Advertising Guidelines!
There has been some clear confusion about what advertising is and isn't allowed. I'm here with this post to clear things up once and for all. However, these guidelines might change in the future and are not final but are effective immediately.
### You are allowed to post about:
- Large contests that anyone can join and that do not require anything like love, favorite, or follow to be allowed to join.
- Auditions, as long as anybody is allowed to audition and it is open to all parts.
- Popular projects or trends that are going on, as long as you actually talk about the project itself in the post and give some backstory to the popularity.
- Anything else **as long as it is relevant and benefits the entire community**- and absolutely nothing that is intended for getting views.
### You are not allowed to post about:
- Personal projects that you have.
- Personal projects that your friends or other Scratchers have.
- Your own profile or **profiles outside of Scratch**.
- Anything not mentioned here. If you have questions, please ask on [our profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheDailyGobo/).
