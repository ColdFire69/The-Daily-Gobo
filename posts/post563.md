How to animate!
1. Decide what's going to happen
2. Draw the sketch
3. Erase the parts you need to move for animation
Before you continue, there are some thing you need to know. Like easing. Your animations can't instantly be at it's highest speed. It needs to gain speed. Closer frames means slower animation. Spaced out means faster.
4. If your animation looks slow, delte some frames in the middle.
I hope this helped a bit.
