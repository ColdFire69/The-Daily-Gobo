Hello bloggers of The Daily Gobo! As a curator of the Scratch Daily Gobo studio and blogger of The Daily Gobo, I see that curators have been posting unrelated projects everywhere in the studio. These are now deleted but please! Continue blogging on The Daily Gobo but please do not put random projects in the studio! For more info, please read the Community Guidelines and posts from moderators to know the latest updates! So...keep blogging and no advertising!
