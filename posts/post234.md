# The Daily Gobo Formatting
##### All the information below is what I've seen and figured out by using this, I haven't looked at the code to make sure.
Believe it or not, The Daily Gobo does have some basic formatting, so let's dive in!

ㅤ

The Daily Gobo seems to have some [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), but not all. Below I will show you how to use it.


ㅤ

If you look at [this markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), you will see that there are loads of features of markdown, but as of writing, only a small amount of these are supported by The Daily Gobo. You can use them by just typing them in the middle of your blog like this:
```
# Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
Aut ducimus galisum est facilis nihil et voluptas aliquam qui vero quis est quia est adipisci repudiandae. Qui iste 
quibusdam ut quia facilis in maiores eligendi aut nesciunt odio qui harum facilis?
### Est voluptate totam
*aut autem veniam sit delectus voluptatem quo dolorum rerum id tenetur maiores et reiciendis dicta.* 
**Et autem asperiores et temporibus eligendi nam aliquam nostrum sed quis accusantium ab numquam expedita qui
 cupiditate accusamus. Est internos veniam a voluptatem eligendi aut optio vitae? 33 nostrum galisum qui nesciunt debitis sed 
amet galisum et repellat animi et minus necessitatibus sed voluptas veniam sed natus nihil.
At iste facere in deserunt consequatur et dignissimos iure. Ea beatae ratione ut sequi libero aut veniam quia.**
```

## Tips
You might have noticed in the daily gobo it's very difficult to make a paragraph break. But I found a slightly messy way to do it.

ㅤ

When you are on the end of the last line of your paragraph, press enter twice, then paste in the invisible character, then press enter two more times. Then you can start typing your next paragraph.

## My Blog Schedule
I've decided to make a posting schedule for myself. I can't guarantee I'll stick to it, but I'll try my best.

ㅤ

Every morning, at around 7:45 AM GMT, I will post a blog, and every evening, at around 7:00 PM GMT, I will post another, usually bigger post.

## Conclusion
I hoped you liked this blog post, make sure to like and fave it so more people see it. I'll be posting another post this evening, probably episode 3 of my python tutorial so see you then!
