Hello world!!
-
this is my first post, and i want to tell you my posting schedule so everyone can stay up to date.

weekdays: 4:00 PM EDT (5:00 PM in November when daylight saving time ends)


(i only post on the weekdays sadly, because during teacher work days, public holidays, religion, and breaks, i'm busy at these days)
