#Basic Markdown
Hello everyone! Today I have some markdown tips for you. In case you didn’t know, this website is built around markdown so you can use it in your posts. <br>
#What even is markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. This means that you can make your boring old text come alive by inserting images, changing how the text looks ect.<br>
#Basic markdown tips
For titles, you generally want to use a big font, like the one above. To do this, just type a # before the text, please note that this cannot be used in sentences as it's meant for stuff like titles and chapters. <br>
Line breaks. Line breaks are useful if you want to separate your text into paragraphs, for example, <br>
Intro<br>
Tutorial here<br>
Outro<br>
To do this, just type < br > without the spaces I have put to make it visible. <br>
Images. Images are great if you want to include a visualization of what all that confusing if(touching(grass)) then say(gigachad) means. To do this, just type ![] and put the image URL inside of the brackets. <br>
The Daily Gobo apparently also supports custom HTML code, such as <button>this sussy button</button>. Don't try taking advantage of this as it will terribly backfire.
