How to make good games
1. Use tutorials! There's no shame in getting help.
2. Be original, you can find inspiration from other scratchers, but make sure to create your own thing, not another generic game that everyone makes.
3. Once you have your game, share it with people, your followers, friends, and then if people like it, make sequels! Or make different games, then, you'll be a great coder!
