Heyo, This is my first post.
It is about the sprite library.
so, most of you have used this. But, a lot of you don't use it anymore.
which is great, I respect your choice and support it. But, let's talk about the scratchers who DO use it. 
And it's not just me. This post isn't to get ME popular. To be honest with you, I'm not all that good.
Sure, I have a few actually funny animations out there, but- actually, forget that, let's move on to the main point. I literally said this post wasn't about me. I have seen AMAZING projects, where, it isn't popular just because it has the sprite library instead of drawings. Now, you may be thinking, so? That is just them being lazy cuz' they don't feel like taking the time to draw. But, I don't think that's true. Um, have you tried to draw on a laptop without any special electronic pen or whatever? Yeah. It's pretty hard. so, I say the next time you see a good project with the sprite library, drop a love. A favorite. a comment. Something.













Anywayz, I'll seeya later, BUY!!
