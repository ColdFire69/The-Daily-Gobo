# An Update
Hey everyone! Just a quick update on some things having to do with The Daily Gobo:
1. We've hit 300 users!! This is such a big number, and we'd like to say thank you to everyone who has helped us get here.
2. We have disabled images in posts. All new posts and old posts will no longer be able to display images. This might change in the future, but for safety reasons, we've disabled them.

Thank you, and have an amazing week!
