I have long teased a game I am planning to make, the only problem is I'm waiting on getting a good computer to make it. So I am sometimes a bit stuck just making trailers and lore. Hopefully soon I'll get this computer, it's powerful enough to run the scratch saga by @WazzoTV . So yeah, keep waiting!
