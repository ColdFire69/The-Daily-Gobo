Ok, so I know this is kinda off topic, but I just want to make this clear. Peater is not my real name. Peater is the name of my pea-sona (peashooter persona), and it is also one of the names I go(bo)* bye on scratch (as well as Wooper**) Just trying to make this clear! * = SYSTEM CRASH REFERENCE REAL??? Answer: maybe it is maybe its not ** = Wooper is the name of my other OC/Persona
