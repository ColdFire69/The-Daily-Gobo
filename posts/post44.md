# Tutorial
##How to use Scratch!
###Steps:
1. You have to go to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
2. An account has to be made for you to share projects, so click **Join Scratch**
3. After you put all the information, you have to click **Create**, which is located on the top bar
4. Now you are on the **Editor**, it's the MOST important part of Scratch, why you may ask? Well, because you make the **projects** there.
5. After discovering the interface, you will realize at the **Code** section, there might be blocks, those blocks are used for **CODING** the game. Also, there will be a tutorial pop-up menu, so just close that :)
6. You have to discover what the blocks mean for you to become **Pro** ðŸŽ‰
##7. The list below will tell you what's the meaning of some basic blocks
- move ( ) steps = well moving steps (horizontally)
- go to x ( ) y ( ) = positioning your object (it's **REALLY** important)
- the change (x/y) family of blocks = similar to moving steps but with more directions
- say ( ) for ( ) seconds = a speech bubble
- change the size and set size = it speaks for itself, it changes the size of the object and set's the size of the object
- show/hide = easy, show and hide the sprite
- play sound ( ) until done = Usually used for playing long soundtracks, not sound effects
- start sound ( ) = Used for sound effects
- when ðŸš© clicked = **Most important block** because it starts the project, without it you can't do anything.
- forever = repeats and repeats forever
- key ( ) pressed  = put it if then loops, senses if the key is pressed 
- +/ - / x / */* = calculations
- set/ change/ show/ hide variable = ** variables are used to store data, setting the variable sets the data, and changing the variable means changing the data while show and hide are more for the interface of the project, showing the data or hiding the data.**
- make a block = making your OWN custom block.

*I hoped this helped you in your journey to become a **Scratch** pro! ðŸŽŠ
