#The Japanese Trending

Many problems have been going on with Scratch... mass reporting, f4f, Scratch getting hacked and glitched... but one of the most annoying and worst yet... trending has been taken over by Japanese projects. For the past few months since the middle of summer, trending projects have started to get more and more Japanese... and at one point, the top 48 projects were all Japanese - why is this happening? Read more to find out...

If you have been on Scratch for a long time, you probably know what the trending glitch is. Every May-June, trending breaks for a few months, getting stuck, and then unbreaks slowly and gets back to normal. The Scratch Team has done some efforts to fix the glitch in 2021, but those didn't do much except stop the resharing of projects getting on trending. 

So is that the reason? Possibly. These trending breaks usually stop in a few months, but this time, it's almost November and it hasn't stopped, which means something is unusual. Also, the glitch has never been associated with projects in other languages, except for a few exceptions. The fact that there are only Japanese projects means something is wrong... but what is the problem.

To find out these answers, I spent some time doing research. According to the Scratch statistics, which I have been tracking for a couple months, Japanese users have risen exponentially. First they were pretty low on the list, probably 10-20th place, but now in the past 2 months, there have been over 100K new Japanese users, which accounts of a total of 5-10% of total joinings, instead of the average of 1%, and the numbers have been climbing the lists. I also asked a ST member about the Japanese trending, and she said that she doesn't know about it that much, and if it's a glitch she hopes it's fixes soon. This implies either she is lying - keeping truths to hide that Scratch got hacked from the public, the higher members are associated with something secret and wrong that the ST member doesn't know, or even the ST doesn't even know how to fix it, as they are to busy preventing the majority of the hackers and stopping mass reporting. The Scratch database doesn't even have a good firewall, I know several Scratchers who have succeded with hacking others. Also, one of my friends shared a version of deip.io (not the real), but even though there are much worse projects on Scratch, it was reported for being violent, or if the Japanese interfered, because he kept a lot of time and effort into it.

Another factor - The Japanese may have predicted the glitch, and they found it a perfect time to break into Scratch as they can easily blend in with the surplus of glitches and problems. This allows the Japanese to easily do whatever they want to without being stopped.

**Wrapping it all up**

Simply, the Japanese (not trying to saying the Japanese are bad, this was probably done by a group of Japanese hackers (or one person) that hacked into Scratch) hacked into Scratch easily as the ST are busy trying to solve other problems and created a bunch of bots that follow, love, and favorite each other - and simultaneously, they make more problems and glitches for Scratch. 

The Japanese are preventing the good projects from being seen, and ultimately ruining Scratch and making people not like it - starting from just basic stuff as breaking trending and making good projects get taken down, ruining people's effort and trying to make people leave or not like Scratch. The increased number of people hacked has also increased, as the Japanese are hacking other people for the same reason.

Thanks for reading, and more info coming soon! :D
