STOP MASS REPORTING STOP MASS REPORTING
i saw lots of popular projects and when I went to look at them again they were gone so I checked and were mass reported
they never broke any rules or anything bad
some mass reporters are lying and saying there was something bad in it
they usually write other or smth that's not true
it really needs to end like REALLY
mass reporting wasn't always a thing in scratch though 
it started a Lil while back(idk when) some people report if they don't like the project
and some people even report for no reason
IT NEEDS TO STOP
but mass reporting doesn't mean being reported for no reason it means being reported a lot of times
but in scratch mostly its reported for no reason and all that stuff
we need to stop the bad mass reporting
not the normal good one though as that's not bad since normal mass reporting is when its reported a lot of times because its not appropriate that one should stay but in scratch ST needs to do something about this
they should remove the "other" option instead replace it with "other" and after that it asked what is the other thing
so it NEEDS to stop the bad one though not the normal good one
