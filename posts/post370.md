#Key Tips & Tricks To Mastering The Daily Gobo

Hi everyone! I'm going to tell you how to master all the features of The Daily Gobo so you can make your articles as good as possible! I hope you enjoy and you learn something, and I can't wait to see what you might do with your articles! If you use this in your articles, please love and favorite! :D

**Headers:** To start off, I want to tell you how to make a header, like the one I have at the top! To do this, you must keep a # before the text you want, for example, I did #Key Tips & Tricks To Mastering The Daily Gobo. You must do this at the start of your paragraph, and to do different types of headers, such as subheaders, etc, you must keep extra #s before your text. For example, if I were to use "headers" as a subheader instead of bolding it (which I will tell how to do later), I would do ##Headers, and the more #s you keep, the more minor your text becomes. After keeping a header, you are recommended to keep a extra line above (only above if it is in the middle of a text) and below to avoid glitches.

**Bolding:** To bold, you must keep a ** your text ** without the space, which would look like **your text**. Basically, you have to keep two asterics on either side of the text to make it bold. It's pretty simple, and there are almost no glitches, so I hope you use it soon :)

**Italicizing:** Italicizing is basically the same thing as bolding, but instead of keeping two asterisks on either side, you have to keep one. For example, you have to do * your text * without the spaces, which is *your text*. Like bolding, there are almost no glitches with this.

**Horizontal Line:** To keep a horizontal line like the one above at the top-ish, you have to keep for dashes right next to each other, by doing this: ----. You must keep it at the start of the line for it to work. This will provide a line going throughout the post, but there are a few glitches. You must keep a black line between whatever is above the horizontal line, otherwise it may bring some unwanted glitches. You don't have to keep a black line below it, but it is recommended just in case something goes wrong.

**Lists:** Lists are very easy to keep, it's just like the normal list on any other typing document, but takes up a lot of space, which is why I am not showing you it in this post. For a number list, you do 1. Text *enter* 2. Text etc, and for a non-number list (dashes) you just keep dashes instead of the numbers. I don't really use them very frequently, so I'm not sure if there are any glitches or not.

**Images:** Images are a little more complex than most other features. You have to go to google or any place where you can find/see images, double/right click on the image (whichever one you have on your computer), and click Copy Image Address. Then you go back to your post, and use this format: ![Text right next to the image? Leave blank if none](Paste the image address) This way, your image will be here :)

**Links:** To do a link, you have to basically do the same thing as with the image without the exclamation mark. Copy the link you want it to be redirected to, and then use this format to keep the link [Text].(Link), but without the period. For example, if I wanted to link my post The Japanese Trending, I would do [The Japanese Trending].(https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/334/) without the period (sorry if the formatting is off because the link is so long). It would appear like this: [The Japanese Trending](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/334/). This also has no glitches :)
