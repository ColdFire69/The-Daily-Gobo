# How to code in Python - e.p 1
### Why should you code in Python?
If, like I did, you're getting tired of Scratch, and all it's missing features and limitations, I suggest you should move onto Python. It is much more powerful than Scratch, with many more features, but where it is a bit lacking from scratch is graphics.

It has graphics libraries (tkinter, turtle, pygame and more), but these are all limited and hard to use. But even if you want to make games, you should learn Python, because then you can learn languages like C#, which let you make games much easier using engines like Unity.

### Installing on Windows

Go to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/) and scroll down to the bottom of the web page. Then select "Windows Installer (64-bit)". Let it download, and then open it. Do what the installer tells you to do, and make sure you select "Add to PATH". To test it out, open the command prompt and type "python" and then, press enter. If it worked, you should get a prompt like ">>>". Exit it by typing "quit()" then pressing enter. You are now ready for the next tutorial.


### Installing on Mac OS

Go to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/) and scroll down to the bottom of the web page. Then select "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer". Let it download, and then open it. Do what the installer tells you to do, and make sure you select "Add to PATH". To test it out, open the terminal app and type "python3" and then, press enter. If it worked, you should get a prompt like ">>>". Exit it by typing "quit()" then pressing enter. You are now ready for the next tutorial.


### Installing on Linux

Almost all Linux distros already come with python. To check open the terminal app and type "python3" and then, press enter. If it worked, you should get a prompt like ">>>". Exit it by typing "quit()" then pressing enter. If you don't, then try installing it from your package manager. If you still can't install it, comment on my scratch profile and I will help you.

### Other Operating Systems

On other operating systems there may be a way to install python, but I recommend that for now, you just use an online python interpreter like [this one from Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). 

### What next
I will be releasing the next in this series in about a day, and it will include install VSCode and making your first Python hello world program.
