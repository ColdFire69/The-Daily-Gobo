## Random Helpful Scratch Tips

##### Here are some tips to help you code on scratch and hopefully fix some errors

### Clones and Variables
- When using variables with clones, **always** remember to turn ‘for this sprite only’ on if you want the clone to have it’s own variable, instead of using a variable that everything else is using. For example, if you spawn 30 clones and want each of them to have their x and y coordinates in a variable, turn on ‘for this sprite only’, because if you don’t all of the clones that you spawn are going to be changing a variable accessible to all the clones, and you wont get to see the x and y of each clone, but rather the x and y of all the clones which will keep changing because the each clone will keep trying to override it.

### Common Mistakes with Pen

- When using a loop with pen, like say to draw a square over and over at a specified x and y with arrow keys movement, always remember to use an ‘erase all’ block at the start of the loop.¹

  ⠀

- While using pen, always remember to use the ‘pen up’ block whenever you want to move the sprite without it drawing after pen is down, if you do not use the ‘pen up’ block, whenever the sprite moves with the pen down, it will draw.

 ⠀

- You shouldn’t see a pen project with 3d and cool features like rgba coloration with raytracers and think that pen is too hard. Pen is actually easy to conquer if you have the time and are willing to learn how to use it. Pen doesn’t have to be used to make complicated projects like raytracers and 3d simulations, you could just make a chase game with circles chasing a square, it’s that simple.

 ⠀




1. **WARNING! DO NOT PUT THE ERASE ALL BLOCK AT THE END OF YOUR LOOP, OR THE PEN WILL NOT RENDER!**

### ‘My Blocks’ Category 

- The ‘My Blocks’ Category can be very useful at some points with scratch. There are many uses to the ‘my block’ and I will talk about all of them here. 

#### The ‘run without screen refresh’ Option

- This option, when turned on, will enable your code under your custom block to be executed all at once! Of course the blocks will still be executed in order, but they execute without the screen refreshing to render what each block is doing, until your custom block’s code finishes.

 ⠀


- In some cases, you don’t want to have ‘run without screen refresh’ on, for example if you are using pen to slowly draw an image on the screen, you do not want ‘run without screen refresh’ on because that would make it draw the whole screen at once, instead of being able to see what it is drawing slowly. 

#### Boolean Operators

- The ‘Boolean’ input for the custom block is a *true/false* statement, meaning that if you put this input in your custom block, you can use it to run different statements with the custom block, depending on weather the statement input is true or false. For example, if you wanted your block to make the sprite turn clockwise 90 degrees if a Variable is equal to one, and make the sprite turn counter-clockwise if the variable is equal to zero, you would use a Boolean operator.

#### Number or Text Input

- The number or text input is used to tell a sprite how much, or what. This might sound confusing, but it is actually really simple. ‘How much’ means to tell the sprite how much to do something of. For example, you could put in a number input to tell the sprite how much to change its x position.

 ⠀

- The ‘what’ or text input is to tell a sprite what to say, usually. This could be used to tell the sprite what to ask, as in the ‘ask? (input) and wait’ block, or the ‘say (input)’ block.

#### Label

- The label is used to, as it says, label your custom blocks. The label is very useful, as you are able to see what inputs are if you label them, and you won’t get inputs mixed up, like I did when I didn’t use labels.

That’s all for this post, hope you learned something. 
I have a project with some [resources](https://mirror.turbowarp.xyz/#744094631) for the custom block part if you didn’t understand everything :D
