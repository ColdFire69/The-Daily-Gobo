#Celebrating Halloween... On Scratch
Hi everyone! We are fast approaching Halloween and in order to celebrate, I've decided to dedicate a post to celebrating Halloween on Scratch. Now, Scratch is jam-packed with fun competitions and activities to take part in all year round- and from past experiences Halloween has been particularly big.
-
*Let's start with Scratchtober, a studio you can access through the "Featured Studios" Section on the front page. A new prompt is given everyday during the month and everyone has the chance to enter as long as their project is related. This year, I entered my project (Stars- a brief guide) into the Star prompt. Scratchtober is a brilliant way to celebrate the build-up to Halloween.
* You could create your own Halloween based project. Ideas include a Candy Collector game or spooky animation! Not only would this be fun for you, but also other people.
* Get Baking! There are plenty of autumn based recipes on scratch- my favourite being "Lets Make Apple Treats" by @AquaLeafStudios. Afterwards, you could share your baked goodies with scratch and maybe even post a recipe to go alongside. I suggest giving credit to the original recipe maker though.

*There are also many studios that host Halloween competitions or even Virtual Halloween Parties. Check them out!
So, whether you enjoy the creating side or more social side of scratch, there are plenty fun activities to take part in this Halloween. I hope everyone has a fabulous autumn half term and look forward to doing some of these myself! :)
