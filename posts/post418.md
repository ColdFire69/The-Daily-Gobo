# Updated Formatting post
*Note: I heard that they use markdown for formatting, so go to [Markdown Cheat Sheet]()https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) because I cannot include it all*
***
## Heading
One # for heading one (# Text)
Two # for heading two (## Text)
Three # for heading three (### Text)
*You can do up six # for headings*
***
# Bold and Italic
italic: * text *
Bold: ** text **
***
# For that line
do three *'s

There are more styling, but Daily Gogo I believe does not support it all
