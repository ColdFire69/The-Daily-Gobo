#The Daily Gobo Update (Leaving?)

Hi everyone! I was working the post that was removed because of a glitch, and was 95% done with over 20+ hours of work, but then my computer did a software update. This happens multiple times, and to prevent this from happening again, I am leaving until The Daily Gobo creates an editor that saves you progress on your post. Bye, and I hope the creators add this feature soon, otherwise I'm leaving forever. Thanks for understanding, and bye :(
