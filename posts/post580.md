Hello! Today on @MARIOPLAYER9000 s game review we will be reviewing a new featured game called Quidditch Run in the game you play as harry potter as you collect items and put them in the goal in the game the enemy's are these multiple colored towers a black ball and a slytherin dude flying on his broom as a player like harry potter (also the black ball is called a Bludger) the items are a snitch which is the little yellow ball with wings you collect red balls called Quaffles you can also collect galleons (another word for gold) and you deposit them in a goal which you see every once and a while oh ya you can also change your broom at the menu theirs 4 brooms (i think) that change your broom handling and speed its a really nice feature for all players to use over all I love the background being pixelated and all but I kinda dont like how Harry Potter is all cheerful even though in the real Harry Potter he wasnt so cheerful during the game over all a really nice game I would give it a 8.4 (which is a nice score if u ask me) that @MARIOPLAYER9000s reviews and have a nice day! @MARIOPLAYER9000 out.
