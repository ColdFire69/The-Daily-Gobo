How To Make A Custom Mouse Trail

First make sure you do when green flag clicked, go to mouse pointer and create clone of myself forever.
Then do when I start as a clone you can make any effect but I'm doing change color by 25 percent, then change y by -10 forever, that's the code!
(If you want to make the costume just go to costume then make a character or just use a scratch costume/sprite.)
