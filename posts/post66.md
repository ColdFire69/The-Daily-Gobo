# Some New Changes!
- There is now a new badge! The badge is a crown (ðŸ‘‘) and you will see it next to the names of any admins. Admins can promote and demote writers and moderators- if you want to become a writer or a moderator, just ask one of them on their profile.
- There is now also a spot for the trending post on the front page! The trending post is the post with the most loves and favorites from the past 24 hours! (Thanks to popjam12 for suggesting this!)
