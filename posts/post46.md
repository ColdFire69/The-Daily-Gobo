Hello! This is about how to get decently popular! You want to get popular? Let me try to help! First, what do you like? You might like music, art, animation and more. You should try to find other people who like similar things! Then maybe get to know them more and you could follow each other! Just don't stop talking to them after that. That would be really rude. I hope this can help! Just don't get mad if it doesn't!
