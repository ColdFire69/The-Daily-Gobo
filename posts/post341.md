Scratch Dots Desc. (I just wanted to put the SDS's Dots desc. in here)
Do you know you are surrounded by dots? Dots can be found in every day locations or places you least expect them. You can find them within sentences, in decimals, within art, and in nature. You can spot a dot in an animal’s fur pattern or a blueberry on a bush or even stars in the nights sky. Dots really are everywhere! In this SDS, we’re inviting you to create a project that incorporates dots into your creation!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Make an animation about a dot that comes to life
- Create a game about a dot looking for it’s home within a sentence
- Design an interactive pointillism art project
- Code a puzzle game where you have to turn a dot back into a sprite
- Make a dress-up/Design-your-own game for a dot
- Write a story about two dots of sand becoming friends on a beach

Remember, these are only suggestions! You are welcome to come up with your own ideas as well, or take inspiration from projects already in the studio!

Please submit a single project shared no earlier than one month before the start of this Design Studio (this studio started on September 30, 2022, so projects made after August 30, 2022 can be added). If you don't have any projects shared after that date which fit the theme, feel free to make a new project and submit it!

All projects must meet the community guidelines and be appropriate for all ages.

It may take some time for your project to be added. Please be patient, we add projects oldest to newest, so we see all of them. No need to double post!
