#Hi everyone! 

I'm @sciencedolphin9 on Scratch, and I can't wait to post here! Lots of you may know me from Scratch for making the Quest Of Darkness series or something else... and if you don't know me, please comment on my profile, and I would like to meet you :) 

I will try to post pretty frequently, and you can expect to see me posting sometime soon! I have lots of tests that I am currently studying for though... that may delay a few posts. 

Some feedback for the creators: 1. We should be able to edit our previous posts 2. You should add a comment option :)
If you have any ideas, please comment on my profile! Sorry if this post is short, my next posts will be really long and awesome! :D 

I hope you guys have a great day and Scratch on! :D

Bye! :D
