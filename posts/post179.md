alr blog #2 : Hellooo so today im blogging on my favorite thing in the world. _SCRATCH_ (no surprise there) Scratch is a fun website on coding, but not only that, i made friends. if you didnt know, im homeschooled, so f r i e n d s are a very rare thing for me to have, so thats one of the upsides. Scratch has tutorials on what to do in real life, like rubiks cube tutorials, or link sharing. _Scratch_ is a real fun place!
