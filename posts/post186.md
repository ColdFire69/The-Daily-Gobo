# How to code in Python - e.p 2
So, welcome back to my learning Python blog! If you want to follow along with this, you should have done e.p 1 first. You can find it [here](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/143/). In this tutorial were going to cover installing VSCode, and making a hello world program.
## Installing VSCode
### Windows
Go to [the VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and download it for windows. Then open the file and follow the steps. You should now have VSCode installed. You can try it out now, but I will show you how to use it later.

### Mac OS
Go to [the VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and download it for Mac OS. Then open the file and follow the steps. You should now have VSCode installed. You can try it out now, but I will show you how to use it later.

### Linux
Go to [the VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and download for Linux (.deb is for Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Pop!_OS, .rpm is for fedora, and .tar.gz for all others, though .tar.gz is very difficult to use). You should now have VSCode installed. You can try it out now, but I will show you how to use it later.

### Other Operating Systems
If your using [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) for your python compiler, you don't need VSCode, because it has a built-in (but not as good) text editor.

## Using VSCode
##### Note: If your using Programiz, you can skip to "Using Programiz".
First, open the VSCode app. Then click "open". Go to somewhere memorable, like Documents, then make a new folder called "pytutorial". Select it, then click open. Now hover over the writing "PYTUTORIAL", and you should see 4 buttons pop up. Click on the one furthest left. It will ask you to enter a name, call it "ep2.py". You should always end your python file names in ".py". 

ㅤ

In the bottom right of the screen, you might see a pop-up asking if you want to install the recommended extensions for python. You should click yes, because it makes it so much easier to code in python is VSCode. It is also safe, because they are made by microsoft.

ㅤ

You run your code in VSCode by clicking the play button in the top right. You can see the output at the bottom of the screen.

A quick VSCode tip: When you are coding, you will see lots of suggestions appear while your typing. Use the arrow keys to select one, and press enter to use it.

## Using Programiz
When you load up the compiler, you will see a main.py file. This already comes with a hello world example, so delete it. To run your file you can click the blue run button, and you will see the output on the left. Keep in mind that you can't save your file in programiz.

## Hello World (Finally!)
Open up your text editor (VSCode or Programiz), and enter the following:
```
print("Hello The Daily Gobo")
```
Then click the run button. If your output is Hello The Daily Gobo, then it worked. Otherwise, make sure you typed it out right, and if you still can't figure it out, contact me on scratch [@applejuiceproduc](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/applejuiceproduc/). Now try modifying the writing inside the quotes and running it. You'll notice that you can put in (nearly) anything and it will work.
## Conclusion
If you have any problems or feedback, contact me on my scratch profile, [@applejuiceproduc](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/applejuiceproduc/). If your following along with this tutorial, like it and if you aren't doing this tutorial but are enjoying reading about it, love it. See you next time, where we'll be doing some more actual coding!
