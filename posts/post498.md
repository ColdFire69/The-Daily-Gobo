This is what I'm calling it now, because I forgot the name originally =)
This is where I show good, yet unseen games on Scratch!

##[CONNER'S TYCOON 2](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/334935874/)

What might seem like your average, small-time clicker game is actually a genius cover for a hilarious RPG! You summon little characters to increase your money output.. then, BAM! A big button appears. When you click it, an RPG starts! with each battle you successfully conquer, more money is added to your tycoon! Travel to Australia, fight a toaster, and beat up a dude in sunglasses and have lots of fun!
