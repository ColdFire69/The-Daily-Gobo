I’m currently making two games. 1. The God a god game where you play as well, god. Run your own world, to make more land costs 10 BELIEF to get belief you have to play long enough. For more people costs 20 Belief. 2. Gobo’s Pizzeria, no not a reference to The Daily Gobo lol. Make pizza’s for hundreds of customers make pizzas with lots of toppings! I hope you’re there to play them.
