#You've got a new writer!#
Hey guys, I am MrMasterKeyboard! I am now a writer for The Daily Gobo! You can find my profile here: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MrMasterKeyboard/

Anyways, with that out the way am I am going to review some of the top 3 projects I like on the featured section today starting with "3D shadow" by CauchySheep!

This 3D shadow simulation is really cool! You can change the sun's y and x axis to change the shadow of the box! I think that is pretty cool in my opinion! https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/735550406/

Next we have "100% Pen Mirror Trail Effect" by PrehistoricWaffle!

This mirror effect is very mesmerizing to me! You can add more lines or reduce it to make some more really cool trails! This totally deserves to be featured! Kudos to PrehistoricWaffle here! https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/724881947/

Last today we have "COLORS SPIRAL!" by sekade10!

Along with the cool music and colourful patterns it's actually relaxing! My only problem is that it stops but I'm pretty sure that it can be extended easily! https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717624131/

I hope you enjoyed my first blog post and shoot me a message on one of my projects if you enjoyed it! 

See you soon and have a great day!
