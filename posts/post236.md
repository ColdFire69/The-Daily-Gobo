Hello! This is my first post of the day, and I did it as soon as I woke up. And I'm cold. Back to the topic, I am still hosting the voice auditions for Shards of darkness Ep.1! I am desperate for voice actors and I'm posting as many links as I can. Like on the daily gobo: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/743485782 | And if you don't want that, hares  the link to my latest project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/743485782 | Thats all!
