#The Daily Gobo Guide
## ⚠️NEWEST VERSION⚠️


Categories: Posts, Ranks, Studio
___
Studio: Do NOT add projects without asking! Also, if you want a project to *possibly* be added, you should make it about the daily gobo.
___
Ranks: Fire emoji = Active, Person at a computer = developer, shield emoji = mod, crown emoji = admin, writing emoji = writer.
___
Posts: Make sure you don't have really short posts! You either will be able to post it but then get it deleted OR the website won't let you post it.
(This bug MAY be gone, I don't know though) Try not to spam the post button! It might duplicate your post.
___
Posts: Advertising may not be allowed now, I suggest checking with @MaterArc or @rgantzos.
___
Posts: Keep it safe for everyone. What this means is no inappropriate things and keeping it family friendly.

More soon?
