**Morning Blog Message**

| Opening Message:

Today I want to adress some problems that need to be heard!

1. Japanese hackers have entered the scratch community and have tried to glitch it! (Not trying to discriminate japanese people)

2. Bugs have caused problems with detecting inapropriate projects before 3.0 so this is a problem...

3. Bullying is a problem on scratch but that is not what I want to say... I am saying that when they ban the bully.. Scratchers make cruel and mean projects about him/her. For example, an animation about beating up his OC or a studio about hating him!

| Ending Message:

Hope people reconize these problems and help to solve them(well you can't change a bug unless your the **ST** )
