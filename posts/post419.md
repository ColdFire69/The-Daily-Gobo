#Leaving The Daily Gobo

Hi everyone, as you probably know, I've been working on a post for a few days now, which took around 8-10 hours in total. I was going to share it, but because of the glitch, when I shared it all the data was deleted and all my hard work was ruined. Now, I don't have any motivation to make any more posts, so unfortunately, I am going to be leaving The Daily Gobo. I may consider it if this post gets 15+ loves in 30 hours so I can see if people want me to stay or not, but if not, I will be permanently leaving The Daily Gobo. Bye :(
