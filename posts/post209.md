DOTS


Oh heeey! I'm @MolOtt and as a curator of our current SDS- All From The Dots- I wanted to tell you all about it! So, if you don't know what SDS stands for, it stands for Scratch Design Studio! The purpose of the studio is that every month, the Scratch Team looks at different Ideas for the studio that people submitted, and they choose one they think would be best. So, for this month, the Scratch Team chose dots! You are supposed to make a project about dots or something related to it. If you need ideas, check out the projects from the studio that are on the front page. If you put in a project that is not related, we won't add it. If you submit a related project and it takes a while to get added, don't stress! There is not that many curators and so many projects. We normally start at the projects that were requested a long time ago first and then the recent ones. No need to repost. If it's been a few days and still hasn't been added, then just go to my chat studio and tell me, and I will try to add it. What are you waiting for? Get Scratching!
