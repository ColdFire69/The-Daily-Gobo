# Guide to the daily gobo (delete if there is one)
Categories: Posts, Ranks

---
1. Posts: Make sure you don't have really short posts! You either will be able to post it but then get it deleted OR the website won't let you post it.
2. (This bug MAY be gone, I don't know though) Try not to spam the post button! It might duplicate your post.
3. Ranks: There **MAY** be more ranks now, However they may not be in here. I will try to post updates when I need to, correcting this. [Ranks](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/29/), [Extra rank](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/66/)
4. Posts: Advertising IS allowed, but atleast its not spammy and the only thing you include in your post.
5. Posts: Keep it safe for everyone. What this means is no inappropriate things and keeping it family friendly.

More soon?
