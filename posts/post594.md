## A project idea I've been working on
I was thinking of a 1-to-1 Scratch to TypeScript conversion program where you can actually run the output, almost like Leopard except it would use Scratch's engine. The way *that* would work is probably by providing wrapper functions over Scratch's blocks. 

Using this tool, you could hypothetically shrink a Scratch project by megabytes. 

How? Well, think about it. The `project.json` file provides a representation of every block in your Scratch project, and that takes up a *lot* of space. But with lines of code, it's more condensed, allowing you to build bigger projects in Scratch.

Well, that was your Weekly Nugget. Come back next Saturday for another.

Note to mods: It's sort of relevant to Scratch, right?
