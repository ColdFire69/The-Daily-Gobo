Hey guys! This post is about how to make your projects stand out.

If you want to be noticed, here are a few tips:

     1.) SPEND TIME MAKING IT
When you spend more time on your project, the better it'll turn out.  If you quickly drag out a few blocks and then share your project, it won't be as fun or cool as something that you spent time and effort on.

     
     2.) Make your OWN art

Things tend to look less polished and professional when you use the premade sprites. Take some time to draw your OWN art, and it'll look awesome!

     3.) Add a thumbnail

To do this, paint a NEW sprite. Then, go to the code section. when green flag clicked>clear graphic effects>set (ghost) effect to (100). This gives your project a more appealing look.

    I hope these tips were helpful! Bye!
