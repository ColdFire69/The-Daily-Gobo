#Sciencedolphin9 Post Homepage

Hi everyone, thanks for loving and favoriting my project, [The Japanese Trending](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/334/), it got 21 loves an 17 favorites, surpassing OrangeAwesome's project with 19 loves (Mine just got one love lower as I am typing this). I spent a lot of time working on it, and thank you guys so much! I couldn't even have imagined that my first real post would be so popular!

In celebration, I created the [Sciencedolphin9 post homepage](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32233899/), which will include all the latest information, upcoming projects, my stats, all time records, chance to work with me in an article, and more! I hope you guys enjoy!

Thanks, and I can't wait to post my next article, which should be coming out a few hours! :D
