OSWars has inspired me. I recently released my unfinished OS, <a href = https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/729210778 target = _blank>moriOS</a>. However, yesterday I decided to make it into an open collaboration project. This means anyone can create components to improve moriOS. My goal is for us to create the best operating system on Scratch. If you would like to create something for moriOS, please visit this <a href = https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32312005/ target = _blank>link</a> and put your plans in the comments. Remember, the purpose of this project is to put your and my brain together to create something amazing.
