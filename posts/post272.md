## Adding Pictures to Your Post

### Introduction
Hello! If you have read my last post [here](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/250/), you might have noticed that I have a picture of [kirbo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCt0kQf3fGPTDh3RWXWhKUYV0iLOUgMn95DihRJJbKoF4h2UBsmtOe-ivRNO8kTwUgLQg:https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/712/873/dd0.jpg&usqp=CAU) at the end of my post. If you are wondering how to do this, wonder no more! I will demonstrate in this post how to add images to *your* post, and in part 2, how to add captions to them too!

### Finding the Link to the Image You Want

First things first, to add an image, you will need to get an image (obviously), and then the link to that image. I will be using [this image](https://www.google.com/search?bih=721&biw=1121&dpr=2&fir=_PCSH8j2P96YxM%252CqT_HeQj5lVDy7M%252C_%253Ba9gJx61vx7MJwM%252CUDGoFq0NNGNgSM%252C_%253BO4tphNAzT43MsM%252CHy_5NpzMU_IoJM%252C_%253BxDF1iekSvDblnM%252Cef7_JwLc_yp6LM%252C_%253BCcmFYOUFv0TX6M%252C66-4KPn7Vev-lM%252C_%253Bl9wovcpQpFbQZM%252CjjCTziUyEUcoiM%252C_%253BqB4Xx7fl3kjXdM%252C3c_wU8edRnmteM%252C_%253BMOJydBTEuHbvJM%252CuQnj_K17by6ZoM%252C_%253BlGPhIKjTwSsduM%252C7-BFnzF7LpC0lM%252C_%253BxE-lnyZ0vAr6rM%252CCAw85CHECbsdlM%252C_&hl=en-US&q=gobo+from+scratch&rlz=1C9BKJA_enUS1021US1023&sa=X&safe=active&source=univ&surl=1&tbm=isch&tbs=il%3Acl&usg=AI4_-kSh4ffwkwcz82cDSAUHA53I4Cv17A&ved=2ahUKEwiCxLrbs9n6AhUlMlkFHS6vCsYQ7Al6BAgHEGA#imgrc=a9gJx61vx7MJwM) from google. 
1. First you will need to right click on the image (hold down on mobile), then the menu will pop up, and you should click the ‘open image in new tab’ button. 
2. After you click that button you should be directed to a page that only has your image on it, with no text or anything else, just your image and a white background around it. 
17. After that copy the link at the top, and that is your image link.

### Putting the Image in your Post
So if you know how to link text to websites using [sample text](link  ) without the space, and ‘sample text’ is the text to link, and ‘link’ is the link where you want the text to take you.

⠀

Anyways, to add a photo it’s the same thing, but with an exclamation at the start. For example if I tried adding the gobo picture without the exclamation point, it would look like this:
- [Gobo Picture](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQZWrgammO8VDhXfes1VnOaJCQXewzm7hXkWORaMukA5_hcDBIl2YjQJKPr6cYQipK6OAc:https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/82d4fc9158155.560c97ad1f37c.png&usqp=CAU)

⠀

Instead of being a picture, it would be a link to the picture, which is not what we want. Instead we use the exclamation point to indicate that it is an image. So instead of making it an url, it will be a picture.

### Example Picture

Here is my example of a picture in a post, using my picture of gobo that I found.
