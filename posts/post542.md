<h1>OS Wars 7</h1>

     “OS Wars 7 has officially ended. Thank you to everyone who contributed this OS Wars. See you next time!” This is what OSWars7 said in their most recent project titled “Sunsetting OSWars”. This doesn’t just end the mark of the seventh OSWars, though. According to codecat2012, “OS Wars has ended early, due to inactivity of leaders, and a few other things.” A lot of other users agree that OSWars is becoming less and less active, including @emararks, the one who informed me on this issue. The question is, is OSWars slowly dying? Will there be an OSWars 8? I personally hope that OSWars doesn't disappear. It is nice seeing these huge collaborations make amazing operating systems.
