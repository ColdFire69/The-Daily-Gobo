#The Current State of Scratch...
##Recently Scratch has been slightly less than great, but it hasn't always been this way, now, it still isn't bad, but one bad apple can ruin the whole batch, so, only time will tell where it will go from here. But instead of focusing on the past, you need to look at the present, so I will give some positives and negatives for the current state of scratch!

#Pros: 
Some positive things about scratch today is that people are still kind, although there are a few "bad" people, most of the community is very kind, and they are willing to help out. I recently made something called the A.P.P. on scratch and it is a group to help stop the bullying on scratch and bring it back to it's original peace and unity. And, within the first 5 days there have been about 40 people who want to help out the cause, that is amazing.

#Cons:
You can't have positives without negatives, there will always be a downside, but it can get better over time. As of right now, trending is completely incomprehensible (Unless you know Japanese) and copiers are the most favored followed shortly after generic creators, originality is not looked upon much, but copiers and generic creators get all the attention, which isn't fair to the original creators, or those who put time and effort in to making original projects and never get noticed. And the bullying on scratch is at an all time high, thousands of people get bullied or excluded on scratch by others, including me, I have been bullied through scratch because I am autistic, so I founded the APP to hopefully get rid of one of Scratch's downsides.

#Conclusion
So Scratch now is massively different than it was when I first joined on my first account 6 years ago, but I still can't decide if it is a change for the better or for the worse, but, I will leave that decision up to you, thanks for reading!
