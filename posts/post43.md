Hello! I just want to tell you how to add coments in your coding area! You may already know this, but when i first joined, I had no idea. So...yeah! So, you've finished your coding. You know people might want to remix, but they might not know what to do. You want to put a comment there to help! You can do this my long pressing a coding block or just long pressing the coding area. I hope this is useful!
