# Another List of Changes
We had some issues with posts yesterday, but everything is fixed now. You may have noticed the website go down. Everything is back to normal now.
### For writers: We now have a special link on the dashboard page for a list of markdown tips and tricks. It's a little paper emoji.
### For users: Profiles now exist. You can view anyone's posts, bio (just their Scratch bio), badges, and more!

Thanks for reading :)
