How to get popular | Part 1
1. Be yourself. If you be yourself with your style of art and game, then it will always be yours; its not this insanely popular scratchers style!
2. Be original. If you be original, then it wont just be like all of the pong games on scratch; 99% of pong games are actually exactly the same, and you can't tell them apart!
3. Add thumbnails. Do you seriously want the auto generated thumbnail that scratch made? No! You can make custom dramatic thumbnails! I will soon post a tutorial on how to make a thumbnail if you need that.
4. Inspiration. Its ok if you take inspiration and/or code from someone, but please don't just remix someone's popular project just because its popular and don't change anything! You can take inspiration/code if you give credit to the person in notes and credits, or in the project in a credits section! 
5. Art. Its ok if you pull some things from the scratch library, but people want to see original artwork! So you could use some tools like Gimp, Adobe photoshop or Lightroom to make artwork!

That's all for now. I will soon make a part 2 to this series; How to get popular
Peace!
