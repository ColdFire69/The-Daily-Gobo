These are some things I think the scratch team should allow
1. I think you should be allowed to search "fnaf" due to the fact that (lets face it) their are 100s of projects named fnaf which will never get a view no one will ever know their hard work that they spent hours to make a fnaf remake and it never be seen also theirs not many times that a person has died by a jumpscare even so people could just put a warning and boom! people would be warned 
2. Mass reports: I think no one should be able to spam report someone also stating this makes it possible for someone who lets say for a example: griffpatch could be mass reported just imagine what scratch could come to all the sad faces and angry haters who seek the reporter it would start a riot on scratch so thats why mass reports should be banned
3. I myself feel like there should be a notification for unfollows, unfaves, and unloves since lets say u say on a project (this a example) if u follow me ill follow U ok so this guy follows and u follow them back couple days later he doesnt appear on your recent follower thing since u gained some follower recently well that guy can just go "click" and unfollow u and keep ur follow the only way u could no is A: U check and remember him being a follower. B: U go on his account and see the follow button blue I think they should change this so people cant "scam" other scratchers for free follows

And that is all Thx for reading by :p
