Hey guys! It's my __second__ day as a writer at... __The Daily Gobo__! On my first day I didn't post anything.... (Mainly because it was hard to post,) but here are some __tips__ on how to be a great **Scratcher**!
*These are not 100% guaranteed to work

Tip #1: Try to not **confront** someone who is doing bad stuff. Randomly **confronting** somebody could give you a realization that sometimes they are not doing anything ***BAD***.

Tip #2: Don't break the **guidelines**. Sure, you can do stuff scratch doesn't want to do in a project. But. Do **NOT** do bad stuff, sure, harmless links are fine, but no swear words, inappropriate stuff, etc. It could affect your **reputation**!

Tip #3: Try not to get or start __fights__ and/or __dramas__. This could also affect your **__reputation__**.
Drama causes people either hating on **you** and also the **other person**. So no dramas.

Tip #4: Stealing without **credit** can lead a report and hate from people, it can even cause **follower loss.** So if you steal something, make sure to **credit**, if the original owner wants the project **edited** or **deleted**, do it. For the sake of your **reputation**.

Tip #5 Don't ask for followers. Unless f4f, but only do **F4F** for  people who DO do it. If they don't like to. Don't ask to do it.

Tip #6 Do absolutely **NOT** raid projects, studios, profiles, anything. Raiding is very **bad** and causes **drama**.

Tip #7 Making alts just for following yourself is completely stupid, alts are supposed to be made for in case your account gets **banned, deleted, hacked, or password forgotten.** The **follow yourself on your account trick will probably be fine.**

Tip #8 Be **awesome!** And stay tuned for more posts!
