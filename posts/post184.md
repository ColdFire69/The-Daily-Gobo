Scratchtober is starting soon get ready! Here's the countdown https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/739388752 

What is scratchtober?
Scratchtober, inspired by Inktober, will provide a list of random prompts (words, ideas, themes) for you to use as inspiration. From these prompts you can create artwork, games, animations, stories, tutorials, or whatever else you can imagine! Prompts will be shared in a project starting Monday, October 17, 2022.
I hope you all enjoy scratchtober 2022!
