if you accidentally deleted a sprite you can QUICKLY close tab without saving it and re-open it!
one wrong move though your whole sprite will be deleted (I worked 20+ hours on a sprite but it got deleted :(  NOO)
if you delete a code go to edit at the top and click restore or right click on editor and click the option undo or redo
