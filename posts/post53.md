How to make a story on scratch! 
--------------
So, you want to make a story? Well, I'll try to help! 
1. Make the characters! Give them designs! And the personality!
2. Plan it out! What's gonna happen? Happy ending? Or bad ending? Possible sequels????
3. What type of story are you making? A written one, or a comic type? You don't really have to do anything hard with the written one. The hard story types are the drawn ones. You need sketches and pallets. Once this is done, use the refs for your story.
4. Look back at your plans for the story! If there is something big, use backstory! Don't forget quotation marks or speech bubbles!
5. Draw or write the story. Use description for written stories!
6. Once you think it done, check through it for any mistakes! Then share!
