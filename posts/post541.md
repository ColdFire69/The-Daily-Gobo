Stamp Gacha

Hey you! Yes, you! Why don’t you play Stamp Gacha? What’s that, you ask? Well, Stamp Gacha is a gachapon game where you (yes, you) can earn “stamps” by gacha-ing! (Sounds so cool, right!). To make things better, I have decided to host events depending on the season. 

This season, from September through the end of November I am hosting「秋のイベント」.In this event, you have the chance to get three limited UR stamps, one limited IR 「秋のイベント」logo and one IR Autumn Miku stamp! 

So why don’t you visit this link right here and play!                                  ↓↓↓
