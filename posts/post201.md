# Guidelines
Hey everyone! There has been some clear confusion about what you can and can't post, and what kind of things writers should talk about. I'd like to address them in this post. To be clear: these guidelines will likely change- they are not final, but please follow them for the time being.
- Our guidelines line up with the Scratch community guidelines. This includes all other, lesser-known rules, such as BEsUP. If you don't know what they are, please read them.
- Please don't write personal posts. This means no advertising, and no making posts just to introduce yourself. We are working on making profiles for writers and just users in general- you don't need to make a public post about it.

- Please also keep in mind that this is still a blog website, therefore, your posts should be longer than a few senteces. They should have proper grammar, and should read like a blog.

- They should (for the most part) be somewhat related to Scratch!

Don't know what else to post about? Here are some ideas:
- Trending topics on Scratch
- Upcoming Scratch events
- Scratch tutorials and tips
- Hacks for Scratch (as long as they don't expose serious vulnerabilities)
- Upcoming changes for Scratch or The Daily Gobo

Thank you for reading, Scratch on!
