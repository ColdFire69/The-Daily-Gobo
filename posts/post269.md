#A tag story
####Introduction
I think you've seen animators put #games on their tags or game makers put #animations on their tags, or even #tutorials lol. So here's just a short, fun story I saw, but for the Scratchers' privacy I won't say usernames.
####The Story
So, I was just normally wandering around in Scratch, and that's when I saw some Scratchers chatting. One guy had made one of those generic platformers with a cube with an eye on it (I like to call those "eyecube" platformers, pretty reasonably) and the guy had put #animations and #tutorials on the tags. So then they started discussing about the misuse of those tags, and the creator of the project said that it had the tag because of a sun animation or something (I can't remember lol). So then of course that didn't make absolutely any sense because an animation is like a small 30-second movie made with frames, not a glowing sun, but then the creator kept insisting and the other Scratcher gave up.
####Conclusion
So, guys, we've got to stop this! People all around Scratch are misusing tags, if you want to listen to music you see games, if you want to play a game you see animations, if you want to check out a tutorial you see everything except tutorials! **This is causing a lot of trouble, and only *we* can stop it! Let's work together, and fix this Scratch problem!** #StopGenericPlatformers #UseTagsCorrectly #Blogs

  


Idk why am I using tags here, I guess because it's related to the post lol
