#The Problem With the Trending Page. ( I am not trying to be disrespectful in any manner )

So, when you go on the homepage, there's a lot of noticeable things. 
###1 - Platformers.
There is nothing wrong with platformers. But everytime you scroll through one of them, your bound to find one that has no effort each time you look through. They just have a block as the character, and spikes, saws and lava pits. A majority of the platformers have no effort, and get way more than the ones that have effort. 

### 2 - The Numberblocks Community.
I dont really get why people are obsessed with this. People love this for some reason, but it was made for kids learning numbers. Kids who **JUST** got out of the womb. I don't get why Numberblock's is so popular.

###3 - Random Art.
Yes, you heard that right, and  I don't mean the good art, I mean the people who draw a single dot and they go crazy viral. They usually get so good by having 100004030403043453804803274892985789 groups in the group section, but that's just insane.

### The End.
Hopefully none of you got offended, that was just my personal opinion. Please forgive me if you have been offended by this post, and BackgroundGuy OUT!
