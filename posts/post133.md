I have news for my scratch PvZ game called Plants VS Zombies: Botany Brawl! The Phantom Show event is coming soon! Phantom show is a Halloween themed event that features the OC, Phantom-Shooter by @nediac1234 on scratch! To get him, talk to the phantom shooter in Plant Plaza, and he will give you a code to use to unlock phantom-shooter as a playable character! Jack-o-lantern will also be purchasable in Sherman's Shop! The event isn't out yet but I will post updates on the new Botany Brawl event! I did indeed get permission from @nediac1234 to use his OC in the game. Infact, he was the one who actually requested I created this event as a follow up to the Shockfest event in July! (in that event, the OC Electro by @terrariamosboi was unlockable) I hope you are looking forward to Phantom Show, as I am looking forward to releasing it too! Want to play Botany Brawl? I have a link to the game here! It just released in its 0.1 phase! (the game was in beta testing for a LOOONG time): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/686782574/
