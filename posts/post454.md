#Let's Change Scratch!
Hi everyone... as you all probably know, Scratch used to be a fun place to learn and code, but recently, there has been lots of advertising, being rude, f4f, generic games, and other bad stuff... and no one is doing anything about it, and people are leaving because Scratch is becoming a worse place... but what if you could help make Scratch a better place - and make a big difference?

----
Scratch wasn't like this when it first started. It had no leaderboards for loves, favorites, and follows, and instead of follows, there were friends. But now, after the Scratch 2 update, it changed to followers, and when Scratchstats was created in 2019, people got even more fame hungry and wanted to get at the top of the leaderboard. Now, there are lots of fame hungry people and rude people, on top of hackers and other bad problems. But if we want Scratch to be anything close to how it was before, we have to change it!

We have to stop reporting projects even if you are jeaulous of them, thinking they don't deserve the fame, or the projects isn't that good, etc. No matter if you like the project or not, don't report it unless it is 100% breaking the community guidelines. Scratch was a good website... if we want to make it better, we have do do good stuff ourselves too. The next time you meet  a fame hungry person who is looking for followers, instead of reporting them or being rude back, say something like like "Hi, is it possible if you could stop making follows? You can make projects and get popular that way, and commenting nice things on other projects and helping others. Thank you!" You should say it in a way so it still seems nice, so then you are stopping someone from asking for followers while still being nice.

Try not to be rude to others, it will only make the situation worse. Don't use caps in your messages too, because then it makes you look rude, and remember to stay calm, lots of people's goals are to make you mad and not like Scratch. If things get out of hand or someone is being really rude, you can always use the report button, but please remember that it is a last case scenario.

Make sure to be nice to everyone, even if they are rude or doing bad things. Don't try to report or go against hackers, they are just going to ban you, so ignore them, all they want is the attention that they are banned. And make sure to help others and direct them in the correct direction, even if they aren't a good person in general. Try to make sure all your projects are original projects and non-generic, try to be creative! If you can't think of something, ask someone else to help you!

Thanks for reading, and lets change Scratch! :D
