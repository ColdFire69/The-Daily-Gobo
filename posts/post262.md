I have had an idea about scratch what if we had a studio for competitions??? That is why I'll be teaming up with @coolpoolboyw to make a studio that will be designated for competing against other scratchers. There will be a season in which multiple things are coded/ created for points.  The top scratchers will be entered for finals and the winner will receive a prize. The prize is yet to be determined but the challenge will be fun!!! If you are interested heart and star this blog. If we reach at least 7t hearts and stars I will post more info. I need you to let me know your interested you can reach me at @cowlordking. That's all for now thanks
