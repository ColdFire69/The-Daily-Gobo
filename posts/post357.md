#How to get on the "trending" page?
##You probably don't believe that I know, since I'm an unpopular old person on Scratch. Guess what? I got trending before, with the projects Time Travel and more. 
###Basically, it's really hard to get on trending, the trending page is based on the amount of loves and hearts and views it gets. Usually if it gets more than 50 loves and faves in 1 day, it will be put on about #7 #8 on trending. If you make it popular though, it could get to first, but it's really hard to get it popular. So this guide will help you with everything!

- Since trending page it based on the loves and faves, you need to get them. 
- You can make a studio to advertise your game, I do those sometimes, rgantzos does too (and invite ALL your followers)
- Other than that, you can also tag it with tags, so if someone simply searches "platformer" on scratch, they have a 5% - 70% chances of finding you, depending on the views of course. 
- You can also simply well, advertise it on places that **ALLOW** advertising, if you don't read the instructions properly, you may get banned from Scratch. 
- Add your project to various studios, such as popular ones, SDS studios (Only if it does with the theme of it), featured studios or simply get your project featured :)
- Getting featured is **EVEN HARDER**, why? That's because Scratch by hand finds the feature projects, so the Scratch Team had saw it. 
- You must make a project really special, not too complicated, try to make it "minimalistic". 

#That's all! eeeeeee
