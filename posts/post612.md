# Small Guide To The Daily Gobo:
[The Daily Gobo](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/) is a scratch blogging service which scratchers use to post tips and helpful scripts, guides (like this!), news, + more. It's important to know the key featured and rules you should follow, so keep reading!
 
#Q&A:
**Q: I want to have the badge emoji next to my name.**
> A: The badge emoticon is for moderators- a moderator is someone who can delete posts
 
**Q: Can I have some other emojis then?**
> A: The admins or developers will promote you if you are trustworthy. They don't promote people on request, nor do they promote often.
 
**Q: Wait, how to I get big text? **
> A: The Daily Gobo follows a "cheatsheet", called the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Not all of them work, only *italicize*, **bold**, and the rest in the list of basic syntax should. 
 
 
**Q: Why did it post twice?**
> A: You probably spammed the "post" button too many times. Be patient! It'll go through :)
 
**Q: Why can't I comment on a post?**
> A: Commenting isn't allowed yet as it's an under-moderated chat. In the future, they may add the feature so that the mods can preview every comment, but until then there isn't a commenting feature :)
 
#Guidelines:
**1.** Try to post long posts! Posts that consist of just a few sentences have a higher chance of getting deleted. 
**2.** Keep what your posting appropriate. The Daily Gobo follows the [Community Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines), make sure you do too!
**3.** Respect others. This falls under the community guidelines. Don't use the blog to post links to ganging up on people, or to anything disrespectful.
**4.** Don't use a single post to advertise! You are allowed to link a project, just don't do it in a single post like:

"hi I made a platformer check it out here it is yay bye."

Add something a bit more thoughtful, for example:

"How to make a Platformer!
blah blah blah
blah blah blah longgggg paragraph here
want to make a scrolling platformer? here's how to make it blah blah blahhhhhhhh
here's my [platformer](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/rasddfef/)!"

 **5.** Don't use the blog to spread rumors! Because you have to sign-up to view the blog, don't use it to spread rumors about a scratcher that hasn't signed up, or doesn't even know about the daily gobo. Either way, if they use the tool or not, you should **never** be spreading rumors about anyone.
 
I'll be posting a small guide for scratch related things *hopefully* every week. If you have any suggestions for guides feel free to ask me in my [chatroom](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30600227/comments). See any mistakes in this post, do tell. If you have any questions about "The Daily Gobo", go ask [@MaterArc](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits) [@rgantzos](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/rgantzos/) [@popjam12](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/popjam12/)! Remember to always follow the [Community Guidlines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines)! Scratch on :D - Nat
