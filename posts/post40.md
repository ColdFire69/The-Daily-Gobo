Hi there everyone!
Have you ever wondered how users have featured projects on their profile BUT are unshared? Let me show you how to do it:


Step 1. Select the project you want to feature on your profile but DON'T press "OK"

Step 2. Open a new tab and click the projects button. Unshare the project you want to feature

Step 3. Go back to the first tab and now click "OK"





TADA! Now you have an unshared featured project! I hope this was helpful! Have a good day/night! :3
