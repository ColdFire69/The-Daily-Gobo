#Dark Mode On Scratch!?
So, i'm back again with another post. :)

Well, in a [previous post](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/132/), [DonutsLikesNyanCat](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/DonutsLikesNyanCat/) said that there should be a **dark mode feature** for the actual Scratch Website. What I discovered is that there **actually is!** Have you ever heard of [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/)? Well, it is an ***amazing*** feature that you can install! It allows you to make *all kinds* of adjustments to the Scratch website in *one easy click*! Sadly, it is only available to install on [Chrome](https://support.oc.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360044416111-Chrome-Download-and-Install-Chrome-on-Mac-and-PC), so if it is possible for you to install [Chrome](https://support.oc.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360044416111-Chrome-Download-and-Install-Chrome-on-Mac-and-PC), you should. In my opinion, it is way more efficient and easy to use than Safari, so give it a try if you can :)

Now, as I was saying, there actually is a way to get **Dark Mode** on the Scratch Website using [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/)! Once you have installed it, click on the **Extensions** button in the top right corner of your screen! (It looks like a puzzle piece)

You should see a logo that looks like Scratch. Click on it! Done that? Now click on addons. It should say "Explore all 140+ addons" at the top, and click on the button right below it that says "Open full screen settings"! Now search "dark" and two options should pop up. **TURN BOTH ON!!** Feel free to mess around with these and get the color scheme you want.

If you go back to the Scratch Website, YOU WILL HAVE DARK MODE!! :D
