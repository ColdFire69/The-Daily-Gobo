The Rise Of F4F
............................................................................................................................................................................
I have been on Scratch for almost three months now, and have noticed a current rise in F4F, or follow 4 follow.
People will go to places like @griffpatch 's profile and comment "f4f please." All of us are guilty of doing it once or twice, or multiple times. But I think you need to know your limits. If you want to hit 100 followers by the end of the year, then make good projects, not sit and wait on griffpatch's profile for someone who will actually do it.

Another thing is, people might advertise somewhere. It will, again, probably be on some big place. like griffpatch's profile. A lot of people's first reaction is to immediately reply, "No ads please." This may seem mean, but all these people want is for people to get follows, hearts, and favorites by making good projects. If you want that attention and fame, you need to work for it. It's going to be hard, and there's going to be many challenges in the way. But, if you want it, work for it.
