Hello, I'd like to put some random coding tips.

1. If you want to make a mobile scratch project but don't want the user to tap then miss some kind of alert, you can make it so when clicking the alert, it changes a variable by 1. You can then add a "wait until < >" block to check if the clicking variable reaches a certain value, to then close the alert.

2. If you want to make something mouse scroll and use " go to x: ((mouse x) / number) you'll notice the scrolling goes the opposite direction of the mouse. To fix this issue, subtract ((mouse x) / number) by 0 as in the scratch engine anything minus 0 gives a negative value. The same works with the y axis.

I hope you enjoyed these tips!
