A li'l bit about me

Hi, I'm Rocky! I like sharks, coding, 80s rock, Arsenal FC, and my two cats. I started Scratching because I was learning about it in school. I tend to make games and random "tools" and features. My message record is 15,423 because I got featured. My favourite Scratcher is probably @Yersinia07 for games (so underrated) and @-LegendGaming- for animations. Scratch on fellas!!
