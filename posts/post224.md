# Small Guide To Discussion Forums:
[Discussion forums](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/) are a place where scratchers create topics, help others out with their topics, ask for help, collaborate, the [Scratch Team](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits) announces [new sprites/wiki wednesday/new add-ons](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/5/), and so much more. 

#Q&A:
**Q: When I press "post", it doesn't work.**
> A: Once you post a reply on a topic, you aren't allowed to post again for 60 seconds/aka 1 minute. This is totally normal, you aren't muted. One thing to note, if you *are* muted, you just won't be able to post for as long as you are muted for commenting/adding projects/inviting/etc.

**Q: How do I create a topic?**
> A: First, go to the [discussion forums page](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/). Then, click on a subject that is highlighted in [blue](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/288183433/) and in **bold** letters. Note: the "Announcements" page is used by the Scratch Team. I'm don't know exactly *which* scratchers, but only a *few* scratchers and the scratch team can post on it. 

**Q: I can't find the reply box.**
> A: If you aren't muted, it's because the topic that you're trying to post on was closed. This could be because the was closed by the Scratch Team, or the creator of the topic was done with it. A topic can be closed by pressing the "close topic" button at the bottom of the topic page. You can only close it if you are the creator of the topic. If you accidentally close it, you can only try to re-open it by reporting the topic saying you've accidentally closed it, and you'd like it to be re-opened. It'll take about 24 hours, be patient!

I'll be posting a small guide for scratch related things *hopefully* every week. If you have any suggestions for guides feel free to ask me in my [chatroom](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30600227/comments). See any mistakes in this post, do tell. If you have any questions about the forums, it's best to ask a [Scratch Team](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits) member as they will have the best answer, not me, not a SDS helper, not a scratcher, the Scratch Team. Remember to always follow the [Community Guidlines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines)! Scratch on :D - Nat
