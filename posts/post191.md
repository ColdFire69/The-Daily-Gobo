Hi. It looks like everyone is doing the "little bit about myself thing", so I guess I'll do one for myself too.

I'm 12 years old

Birthday January 17th

Multi-Programming-Language Coder and (real) OS developer

Rugby player (a sport)

Now it's your turn! Tell everyone a bit about yourself (if you want).
