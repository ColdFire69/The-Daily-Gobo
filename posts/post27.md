# How to Contribute and Post

It's really easy to contribute to The Daily Gobo, actually! You can contribute with **code**, or you can contribute by **posting**. To contribute with code, you can check out our [repository](https://github.com/The-Daily-Gobo/The-Daily-Gobo)! **If you'd like to contribute by posting, it's simple! Just follow these steps:**
1. Go to [the official Scratch studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32205104/comments).
2. Comment your responses to the following questions:
- Why did you join Scratch?
- Please give an example of a blog post topic that you would like to write about.
- Do you agree to be responsible when on The Daily Gobo? This means not posting anything inappropriate, and remaining on topic. This also means not abusing other users or our servers.
3. That's it! We'll do some reviewing to make sure that you're trustworthy, and then, if you're approved, we'll let you know and a Dashboard button will appear in the top right corner of this website! You can post from there!
