#The Daily Gobo Studio
-As of today, many scratchers and bloggers have noticed the absence of the Daily Gobo Studio. Although no one yet knows why, I believe some people may be looking into it and hopefully the Studio soon returns. It's uncertain whether this was merely a glitch or perhaps the Scratch Team had a reason to remove it. Nevertheless, I wouldn't think there's anything to worry about as being a frequent visitor to the page and studio, I have not seen anything out of the ordinary or potentially harmless. I f anyone has any ideas make sure to drop a comment somewhere or make a post :)

Meanwhile, I figured this is a good time to suggest somethings to do with the studio. While the description holds information on what this page actually is and how to join, I feel that the rest of the studio itself is rather unrelated. There are some fantastic projects added in there but perhaps the studio could do with a more Daily Gobo themed content.

Now, I understand Scratch is not a place for fighting for fame but I have to say that the odd competition/ award given out by the Daily Gobo could be of interest to the users. The idea came from newspapers like "The Times", who do book awards etc. Or perhaps a little bit of recognition for influential writers. This would, in my opinion take the Daily Gobo to that extra fun level but hopefully not become too much about trying to be the best.

Thanks for reading! Please bear in mind my ideas are just suggestions and if anyone disagrees with them, I am totally okay with that. Let's Hope the studio gets back up and running soon!
Have a nice day/night
