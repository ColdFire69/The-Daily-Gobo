Scratchtober is in full blast! I know I can be the only one super excited! Here is the Scratchtober desc.:
Welcome to Scratchtober 2022! Today’s prompt: Forest

See the list of prompts here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/739424600/ 

Scratchtober 2022, inspired by Inktober, will provide a list of random prompts (words, ideas, themes) for you to use as inspiration in projects over the course of two weeks in October. From these prompts you can create artwork, games, animations, stories, tutorials, or whatever else you can imagine!

For example, if the prompt is “Dessert” you could:
Create a game set in a dessert-based world where you must find various ingredients and cooking utensils
What comes to mind when you hear the word “dessert”? Draw it and make it interactive!
Create a project that allows others to design their own dessert
Write a story about a slice of pie who makes friends with a piece of cake
Have a favorite dessert? Create a tutorial to help others learn how to make it!
Design a new dessert from your imagination and bring it to life on Scratch
Remix a project in the studio around this theme and add your own ideas!

Remember, these are only suggestions! You are welcome to come up with your own ideas as well, or take inspiration from projects already in the studio.

The list of prompts can be found here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/739424600/. Every day we will highlight one prompt but you can see the list of prompts ahead of time, if you want to get an early start on a project. You can participate once, twice, or as many times as you would like! Come back every day to see what Scratchers are creating ^.^
