A cheap way to get popular fast!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So basically, if you see a very good project, but feel that it deserves some more love, then you can use this method. It can take some time, but it can be worth it in the end. So what you do is you make a new studio. (you need to be at scratcher rank to do this). Then, put the project you think should get popularized into the studio. Then what you do is you curator invite the most people possible to your studio. Scrape together all the usernames you can find and invite them. This will cause them to get a notification telling them they were invited. Once they see the notification, they are likely to open up your studio. After that, they may look at any projects or links that were inside of the studio, which leads to a view and a possible heart and favorite! This leads to it getting even more views. Soon, the project will get decently popular! 

DISCLAIMER
-
Some people will see this as a non-moderated way of spam advertising (because it kind of is). Whatever you do, DO NOT ABUSE THIS. Only do it every once in awhile to prevent the possibility of people seeing though your plan and viewing you negatively. Also, please do it for actual quality projects. Nobody wants to see a generic platformer in their messages. 

Hope you enjoyed this guide!
