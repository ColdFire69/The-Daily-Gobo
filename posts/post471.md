Making a new game!

I am making a all new game,overtime.Your boss at the supermarket you work at needs you to go overtime and stay after hours,but something you don't know is the supermarket you work at,isn't exactly the most normal supermarket on earth.Monsters are roaming the supermarket,after that it is pretty confusing,but,infinite freezers,coworkers going missing when they were hired for overtime?Something is going on in this store of nightmares.
