Hello guys! Today I will give you guys a tutorial!
How to get popular:
1. Be yourself.
2. Be original.
3. Make thumbnails. If you need help on this check this out: https://youtu.be/PsYXxUc_39I (I did not make that video)
4. Inspiration. I feel like I have to go a little bit deeper into this one, so I will. Its ok if you take one Sprite or script from someone's project, as long as you credit them.
5. Remixing. This also falls under inspiration but I will just clear a few things up. No one wants to see a remix of something with 0-2 things changed. This is however false if they are the entire game engine or the entire theme.
That's all for today! Peace!
