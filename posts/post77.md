<h1>Tutorial<h2>When stop sign clicked detector</h2>Hello everyone! today I am going to teach you how to detect when the user clicks the stop sign! You might think that this is complicated, but it actually only uses 4 blocks! The only downside is that your project can't make use of the timer block if you decide to put this in your project. But without further ado, here is the tutorial:<br><br>1. Go to your project, and open the code tab of any sprite.<br>2. Add the following code:<br><br>When flag clicked<br>Forever <br>reset timer<br><img src=https://u.cubeupload.com/elip100/whentimer.png><br>Then to detect when the stop sign is clicked use the When timer > (0.1) Block to run code after the stop sign was clicked.<img src=https://u.cubeupload.com/elip100/timerdetect.png><br>That's it from me! Have a nice day =D
