#Hello, Everyone!

Welcome to the Daily Gobo! I'm Mooncatdog, also known as Pixel, and I'm here to bring you some cool stuff as a writer!

Every week (I hope), I'll bring you a cool new blog (ok, probably every month...) about the best games and experiences on Scratch!

##First up: [HOMECOME: Creatures of the Night](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/686709830)
Homecome: Creatures of the Night is an action platformer where you play as a little animal dude, on his quest to regain his memory. You meet a little mouse named Mousey, and head on your way, fighting huge bosses as you go.

Sadly, I can't talk much about it without spoiling anything, but just as a hint: look out for arrows (the 'hey, look at this' kind not the 'hey, imma hurt you' kind.).
