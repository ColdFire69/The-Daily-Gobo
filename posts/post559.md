Hi! A few recommendations for Scratch:
1. Remove follows; this would help the community so much! We need this because people have been driven to do face and voice reveals and answer personal questions because of follows.
2. Give you notifications when people unfollow you, and/or unheart and unfavorite your projects. I have almost made a celebration and not realized that I was 1 follower short.
3. Collab with Spotify to be able to quickly choose songs instead of importing them.
