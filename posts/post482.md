Hi guys! It's me, @Cathaven123. Today I want to talk about F4F, and sorta add onto what people before me have said. 
Sooo, F4F, or follow for follow is kind of a controversial topic. You either love it or hate it. Now I have mixed feelings on the subject, like, yes, this was useful when I first started almost two years ago. But also, as most of us know, it's rather annoying for random strangers to pop up on your profile asking for follows. Like, um do I know you? I think there are better ideas to get follows than that. I will usually hand out a follow if you talk to me enough on an interesting subject. So for all of you Scratchers trying to get more followers, please don't just ask. Get to know me first. Comment on my projects. Instead of annoying us and causing us to ignore you, make a new friend. I find this works a lot better.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you weren't bored out of your mind...

Witty
