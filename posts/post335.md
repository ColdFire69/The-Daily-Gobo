Hello again, everyone! I'm @Sonar_The_Scratcher, back with another topic to write about. Scratch evolution! Scratch was first made in 2007, the cat was pixelated and the coding section ws small, and just had blocks in another section where you can grab them. scratch 2, which is basically this version, where you can write your own extentions. Pretty cool right? I think it is too. Scratch 3 had a major improvement from scratch 1. It had a different scratch cat model, more blocks, sounds, more extentions, and they were in categories. Major improvement to the web itself, there were studios, remixes and comments. Now, this concludes my blog for The Daily Gobo. See you next time!

Bye!
