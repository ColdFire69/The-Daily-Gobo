Introduction To Scratch!

Scratch is a great educational tool developed by MIT. It enables nearly anyone to experiment with the basics of vector art, animation, and game development. You can create projects by yourself, or you can collaborate with other creators online! I personally believe that Scratch is a great coding browser and that you should try it too!
