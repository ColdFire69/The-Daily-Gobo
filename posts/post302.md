How to TRUELY get popular on Scratch:
1. Make some good projects! There are many tutorials online! Just use credit from the video or website!
2. Be nice! Being nice might gain some followers or Scratchers who want to follow your projects!
3. F4F! I don't recommend this path as it is a "fake" way to get followers, but if you are new, you might get a few followers!

That's all I have for today! This is jboys846, signing out! See you later!
