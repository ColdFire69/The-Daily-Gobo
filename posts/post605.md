#How to humidify your home
As winter is nearing, the air gets dry and annoying, which can lead to sore/dry throat and coughing. Here are ways to make your home more humid. :)
1. Heat a kettle of water or boil a pot of water for pasta. Let the water boil for a few minutes. 
2. Add house plants. 
3. Open the door right after a shower. 
4. Use a humidifier. 
5. Use the laundry dryer less.
6. Fill a decorative vase and place it on a sunny windowsill. 
7. Add an aquarium to your home.
8. Place a small indoor water feature on a counter-top or table.
9. Decorate the house with flower vases.
10. Put a small bowl of water on top of heating floor grates.
