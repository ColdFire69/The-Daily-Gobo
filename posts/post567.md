Here I am to give my opinion about a game made by @Knightbot63 which by the way had recently hit 1000 followers so congrats to him on that but the game is a game (which is still getting updates) this will be based on the gameplay update so when you first enter the game you click space and begin I really enjoy the music so what you do is jump over spikes and rocks that you die if you hit them overall its like a simple but fun game some things I kinda dislike is how you can see through the stick boys head which makes me kinda feel like the sprites were a tad not the best if you see what I mean like he barely moves his legs to run (which i have no problem with) and the jump animation is decent but I wanna see those legs move just stating this is based on version 1.1.2 the gameplay update as said in the thumbnail over all I say a big 8/10 on this simple but fun runner game I really enjoyed it and I can see me doing this when I have free time.
