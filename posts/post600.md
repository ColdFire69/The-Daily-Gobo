#Want to hear a story?
If this gets more loves than favorites, I’m gonna tell you guys a story about thanksgiving. It was something my school did on purpose, but it’s actually kinda funny. So, love if you want it or favorite if you don’t.

The story’s theme is about a turkey not wanting to be the Thanksgiving turkey. The title is:
Blowing up the farm: Turkey Style (It doesn’t break the community guidelines but the title is the only issue.)

Ok, that’s all I have now, bye and meet you guys for chapter 1!
