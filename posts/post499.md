#The Griffpatch Overtake

As you all probably know, Griffpatch has been the most popular Scratcher on Scratch almost always since Scratch 2.0 came out. You may have thought is possible for someone to ever overtake Griffpatch? But the real question is - how? Read more to find out...

----
As of 2022, griffpatch gains around 200-400 followers a day on average. Most trending people, escpecially if they have good projects, can get just about that amount (btw if you were wondering the record is 3K-5K :P). There are currently no major signs of change in the rate, so overtaking griffpatch is almost impossible... but is still possible.

To overtake griffpatch, you will need years of hard work... it won't be easy. First, get known on Scratch by making really good projects, none that get on trending, but an excuse that you are really good if people look at your projects. Here, you have a really high chance of getting on trending. Make sure none of these projects get on trending, or it won't work. Once you have 5-15 really good projects that will convince others to follow you when they see your profile, make a studio containing the projects so people can find them easily, and follow it. Make sure it has a really good TB. If you aren't doing this from an new account, make sure you unshare all your bad projects. You should have over 100 follows at this point, the higher, the better, but not too much that people think you are overrated and then don't follow you.

After that, you have to keep all your effort into making 30 - ish super good quality projects. Don't share any of them, just keep them stockpiled, and make sure they are 100% the best you could possibly make them. Do this for 1-2 years, while still occasionally sharing projects every 1-2 months which aren't too good, but good enough that your followers remember you and still think you are an awesome scratch. After you have lots of stockpiled projects, now you have to take control of trending. 

Before you do this step, make sure trending is unfrozen or you have found a pattern to share the projects at the correct time so they can appear on trending (I think the pattern stopped though but you can still try). Share your 3rd-5th best project first, and make sure it is absolutely stunning compared to the other projects on trending. Make sure the TB is standing out. Add it to all the studios you can find, and make a studio for it where you invite all your followers and other Scratchers. Ask others to help with managing and invite people to the studio. Hopefully this gets on trending, if not, share a project from the top 3-10 of you projects, and use the same tricks. Repeat this until you get on trending, hopefully soon after this. Try to not use more than 3 projects in this process. Once it gets on trending, wait for a few days before sharing your next project, and link it in the desc of the trending project. To speed it getting on trending faster, repeat the previous process. Do this a couple more times, until you have about 10 left. 

You should be getting a lot of followers a day at this point. Now, work on more projects (hopefully you have been working on some during your "trending reign"), and wait for your project to get off trending. Once it gets off trending, if you still get lots of loves & favorites a day, good job, if not, use the previous technique above again. If yes, share projects around every 2-4 weeks, as you have installed yourself into getting a lot of followers a day without trending and now you just need to keep on reminding others how good your projects are. While doing this, keep working on projects.

There will be a point where all the projects you have made have caught up to where you are now, and at this point, you will be not on trending very frequently. Keep on working on projects, hopefully sharing every 2-ish months with almost a guaranteed chance of you being on trending. At this point, you should have a sort-of higher rate of follows than griffpatch, and if you keep on sharing better and better projects every 1-2 months, you will pass griffpatch.
