<b> <h1> Popularity and its effect on Scratch</b></h1>
<body>Hello. I am XxzinxX, also known as Zin. I have been scratching for over 4 years now (not all on this account) and over all 4 years, I noticed something on Scratch. Some people noticed hate. Some people noticed glitches, some people noticed hackers. I noticed fame. 

Yes, fame. The craving for fame was all over the website. Constantly, people were asking for follows, or loves and faves. And it wasn't just then. Its happening now too. People constantly ask for f4f (which is follow for follow) or directly asking for a follow or me to even just view their project.

<h3>Why?</h3>
When I had just started this account, back 2ish years ago, I had an issue with fame. I would do the things I just described, and a lot more. I would stay on the site, after my parents put me to bed, until 1:00 - 2:00 AM! Why did I do this? Because of the evil, ugly popularity craving. Why did I have a craving for fame? The answer is simple. I wanted EVERYONE to know that I was cool, that I had good projects (not really) and, I just wanted to show them off. And so, I would chat with "friends" and make projects every SECOND of the day, with absolutely no break. If you are wondering, yes, I got caught, and got in trouble. ðŸ˜’

<h3> What scratch was meant for</h3>
Scratch was meant as a place for people to code games and share with other people. Not even follows were meant for fame. They were meant for a system for people to get notified every time their followed person shares a project or loves and faves a project. In my opinion, scratch should completely remove the follow count option, and only show people the person is following, not the people that followed that person. 

The issue of fame is rising, and you can help stop people from their problems

<h3> How To Help </h3>
Say someone is feeling down because they don't have enough follows as they'd like. All you have to do is say some kind words to them. Say something like, "Hey, follows don't matter. Do what you love to do without having to please everyone, becasue no matter what, there will always be someone who will be not pleased." 

<h3> How do <u>I</u> stop? </h3>
Say you're the one with these problems, these troubles. Don't get upset when someone doesn't follow you, or like your project. At least they came over to see your profile or project right? There are 43 million registered scratch users (according to https://hundred.org/), not every one of them are going to follow you or even see your project. It won't happen.

Thank you for reading this. Its important to let everyone see this.
I'm not going to ask for a love or fave on this post because I kind of just posted a long speech about fame issues. So...
That's all
Zin out.
