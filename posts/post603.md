Hi everyone! I'm currently making a school project exploring the pros, cons and possibilities of a Robot reliant future. As part of my research, I figured it would be good to get other people's ideas on this question, as well as mine and information from various websites. I would appreciate for anyone to share ideas on this topic via my profile  https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-Astrxnomer-/

So far, I definitely can see a future in Robots. They can be more efficient than humans in terms of jobs and useful in a lot of different areas, from Entertainment and homelife to Space Exploration and military purposes. However, I do see an issue in terms of powering all these robots, lets say if most average households use them, as well as major factories and jobs. Our energy sources are already running out, and I think that if the Robot revolution does happen, this would dramatically speed up the process. We would have to find a new energy source. Recently, a new mineral has been found on the moon that is believed to be able to power millions of houses from just a small amount. This could be the answer although there is some controversy about mining the moon. As well as this, the increase of use in robots would result in major job loss.

Again, I thank you in advance for any opinions you could provide.
