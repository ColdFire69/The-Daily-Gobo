# How to Earn Badges
There are currently 4 different badges, but we're constantly adding more. The 4 badges include:
- 🔥 - You earn this badge by being active. You must make a certain number of posts each week to keep the badge. It's pretty simple to have if you're active and follow the guidelines.
- 🛡️ - You earn this badge by being a moderator. At the moment, you can just apply by asking on a moderator's profile. We might add a better system soon. Moderators can delete posts and will be able to revoke posting permissions from users.
- ✍️ - You earn this badge by being a writer. Writers can post, and are verified by our team. You must be trustworthy, and you can learn how to become a writer [here](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/27/).
- 🧑‍💻 - You earn this badge by being a developer. You can contribute to our [repository](https://github.com/The-Daily-Gobo/The-Daily-Gobo) and then you'll receive the badge! It's super simple!
