How Did The Daily Gobo Studio Get Removed?!?
___
Okay, I was on The Daily Gobo today, and I saw that TDG studio was removed from Scratch.

-Apparently, it was removed for being inappropriate. I don't know how, maybe it was a comment? Or, it could be a corrupt manager? I have absolutely no idea.
-I think this is a little over the top. MaterArc worked with the Scratch Team to create this website, and now the official Scratch studio is gone. That's weird because only the Scratch Team could take it down. So, they probably got annoyed of it. Or it could just be a comment.
