# Quizlet sucks.
So I did it myself.

I've never really used it that much before -- but now, I hate it. It makes you sign up after 9 flashcards, and you can't even access most things, which makes it useless for what it's intended for.

Introducing my new project, Cadlet.

Cadlet does none of that. Just study. No need to sign up for anything, unless you want to, like if you need to sync your progress across devices.

Cya. I'm not going outside for the next two years.
