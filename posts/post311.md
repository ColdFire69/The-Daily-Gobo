Hi everyone! I have now become a writer at The Daily Gobo, and I'm very pleased. So for this Blog, I will make this topic about scratch itself. As you know,scratch is a very cool coding webite, where you can create, connect with other scratchers, and view other's projects. When you first join scratch, your rank will be "New Scratcher." Not to worry! After 2 weeks, you become a "Scratcher".  As you know, there are certain guidelines a scratcher must follow. Scratchers have to be honest and respectful and must remember that there is a person behind each scratch account. Scratch coding is very simple with the logic and parameters, but it can get complex when making something elaborate. I thank you people at The Daily Gobo for making me a part of this, for it is the end of my first blog. Bye!

Thanks, @SonarTheScratcher
