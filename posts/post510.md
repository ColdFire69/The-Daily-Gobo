# The Unsharing of the Studio
I just heard back about what happened to the studio. Here's what MaterArc has told me:
> The studio got deleted for being inappropriate. I sent an appeal to get it back. *fingers crossed*

Hopefully, all goes well and the studio gets reshared. The Daily Gobo already has a steady user base of 429 users at the time I wrote this.
