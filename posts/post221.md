Formatting

I think The Daily Gobo should add formatting in creating a new post.  I don’t know if there is formatting for computers (I use an iPad), but if there is, you could still add it for mobile.  (You don’t have to it’s fine here is fifty million polite pleases)  
If you don’t know what kind of formatting I am talking about, I’m talking about bold text, big text, etc.
Let me know if you support this suggestion.
(Also thanks for naming the site after Gobo +infinite cool points to the devs)
