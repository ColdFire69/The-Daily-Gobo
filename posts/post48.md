Q: Why do some people have stars next to their username?
A: Because they are a member of the Scratch Team. If someone is claiming to be a scratch team member and they don't have a star next to their name, they are probably fake. You should report the person/people pretending to be a Scratch Team member.

Q: Why can't I publish a project?
A: This could be a glitch. First of all, make sure you're logged in on the project page. Second thing to do if you still can't publish the project is close the project making tab, and then reopen it. If this error keeps occuring, it's probably best to contact the scratch team.
