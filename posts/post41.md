Do you wanna become popular? Do you want some tips? Well here they are!:

1. Add all you projects to studios. (IF you are allowed too)
2. Make the best content you can, and never take other code or sprites! (UNLESS you ask first or give full credit!) 
3. Stay active, if you don't then people might think you left then they won't support you projects bc they think you left. 

I will give our more tips in the future, but until then stay tuned! :D
