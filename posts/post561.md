Hello! I'm back, and ready to describe another game!

##[Crystal Seeker 3D](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/463553665/)
Crystal Seeker 3D is a, well, 3D game created by [ggenije](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ggenije). It's a fully-fledged 3D platformer game where you jump across fully Pen-based levels with 2D coins and enemies. There are three Boss Levels, and two normal levels leading up to each boss. To unlock each boss, you must Time Trial the previous levels to get high scores, and collect enough coins! 

###New Segment: Pixel's Rating!

I give this a 7/10. If the enemies were 3D, this would be amazing. Sadly, the limitations of the engine stop this from happening.
