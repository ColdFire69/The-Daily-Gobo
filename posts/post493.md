# Info about posts

### Introduction
I know I know, I haven’t posted in forever, but I really don’t have any ideas for posts. Now I got an idea tho, and it’s because I’m seeing way too many short posts on TDG, and a lot of them could be condensed into one big post.

### Posts
So as I said in the introduction, I’ve been seeing a lot of really short posts. These posts are usually just asking a question in one line, and sometimes just posting a link and that’s it. 
I just wanted to say that we should keep our posts longer, because short posts just take up space if posted a lot, because of the spacing and the top part which has the badges and the profile. 

### Tips
Some tips to keep your post longer, and not short.
- If you are posting a lot of links in your posts, tru to condense the links into one big posts, and it would be really awesome to add some text explaining what the link goes to, and why you posted that link and what’s at the website on that link.
- Try to think of big ideas. Don’t just do a QOTD (question of the day) and that’s your whole post, maybe talk about what has been happening on scratch or something like that

## Outro
So I hope you make your posts longer, and don’t keep them short, because it would be way better if you do. 
Have a nice rest of your day/night! :D
