# Scratch User Lookup
Ive made a tool where you can look up users (its in replit)

When you put the username in, the response it will give you are:
+ Username 
+ When the user Joined
+ On the scratch team
+ Country of user
***
If the user does not exist, it will tell you.

There will be more features soon like follower count and following count
