## Adding Captions to Your Images
#### This is part 2 of ‘adding pictures to your posts’ go check it out [here](https://thedailygobo.scratchtools.app/post/272/) if you haven’t seen it.

### Recap of Last Time
So last time we learned that using an exclamation point in your link, with the proper link, will turn [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrJJKKDz13WmBXVXEoU3dcJJYD0VDmMJCmre417G65-3G10PVSTGRiBz8ihVfEZmDi0DY:https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/8516530_32x32.png&usqp=CAU) into this

### Adding Captions to Your Post

So it’s actually super simple to add captions to your post and I was just really lazy to put in the other post. :P

1. First you need to put your picture in, I’m using the one I put in this post, found [here](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrJJKKDz13WmBXVXEoU3dcJJYD0VDmMJCmre417G65-3G10PVSTGRiBz8ihVfEZmDi0DY:https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/8516530_32x32.png&usqp=CAU).
2. Second you just need to put your picture in, with the method I used in part one, and then press enter
3. After that add an asterisk (this -> *) then type your caption, then add another asterisk.

So at the end your text should be in *italic* because of being surrounded by the asterisks. 

### Example
My example of a picture with a caption is here:

*A random image I found on the internet xd*

I know this post was really short compared to part one, but I hope you learned something (again). :D

And now here’s a picture of kirbo to make your day better *with* a caption.
