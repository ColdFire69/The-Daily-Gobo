# *A suggestion*

Hello everyone, soo actually there are soo much posts! That's good but it also makes dificult to see all them soo, I have a suggestion for the posters :

Post only three or least post per day, I know ok... You like to post a lot, Me too, but if there are soo many posts per day no one will see your posts...

**Remenber this is only an *IDEA***

Also, pls remenber to only post things that follow the rules =) 
(yesterday I have deleted two posts ( that didin't follow the rules, they were the "about me posts" ...(Also check the rules above or the trending post to see why I delete them)))

Have a nice day, *[WhatijStudios](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/WhatijStudios)*
