I am making a scratch edition of sonic the hedgehog! It is called Tera's Adventure! Tera is sonic because they both are blue and have quill things, scratch cat is tails because they are both orange cat-like creatures, and pico is knuckles, because they are both red! Dr. Robotnik is Robo, the evil twin of Gobo! Want more information on Tera's Adventure? Go to the official studio! Link is right here: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/31940213/
