Hi everyone! I'm happy to say that this is my first post on the Daily Gobo. My name's @-Astrxnomer- and since I was very young, I have been fascinated by space.
In a way, the universe should be our idol; it's beautiful, colossal without it nothing would exist. From the boisterous heat produces powerhouses we call stars to the unexplored galaxies that lie an eternity away, visible as a delicate wisp in the night sky, the universe has a silent eloquence and a delicate vastness that takes the breath away. A common saying states that everyone is different, no one if perfect and we should be ourselves no matter what social or mental barriers are placed in the way. If, 13.8 billion years ago, the universe has become what it 'should have been' and the balance between matter and antimatter was perfect, life would not exist the way we know it today. But the major unprecedented imbalance led to the creation of many worlds - some perilous and uninhabited and some that hold the very building blocks to life. Earth amongst them, they lie hidden like lost diamonds in a mountain of glass.
