#Firewind Sponsor Opportunity
I'm making a new project called Firewind, and before it comes out, I need some sponsors! :) Sponsors will love and favorite the project, and in reward get a shoutout in it! It is the sequel to Snowblown, and if it gets as many views as the first part, this means 80,000 people will see your shoutout. To apply, please go [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/738897570/) and comment "Sponsor"! :D

Enjoy and I hope you become a sponsor! :D
