#Markdown tutorial episode 2
Hey everyone! Here are some more markdown tips: <br>
**Bold text.** You can use this to highlight important details, such as "Do **not** touch the nuke button", to do this just type ** around both sides of the text. <br>
*Italian text*. You can use this to emphezise (amazing spelling btw) sarcasm, such as "This rocket is *very safe*", to do this, just type * around the text.
