# New Scratch Design Studio
There's a *brand new* Scratch Design Studio that you can make a project for! If your project gets added, it could appear on [the front page](https://scratch.mit.edu) of the Scratch website! The new [studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32165724) has a theme: **All from the Dot**. Interpret it however you want! The following description comes from the studio itself:

Do you know you are surrounded by dots? Dots can be found in every day locations or places you least expect them. You can find them within sentences, in decimals, within art, and in nature. You can spot a dot in an animal’s fur pattern or a blueberry on a bush or even stars in the nights sky. Dots really are everywhere! In this SDS, we’re inviting you to create a project that incorporates dots into your creation!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Make an animation about a dot that comes to life
- Create a game about a dot looking for it’s home within a sentence
- Design an interactive pointillism art project
- Code a puzzle game where you have to turn a dot back into a sprite
- Make a dress-up/Design-your-own game for a dot
- Write a story about two dots of sand becoming friends on a beach

To have your project added to the studio, share it and then simply post the link in the [comments of the studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32165724/comments)!
